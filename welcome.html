  <h1>Welcome to the Legacy Family</h1>

  <p>
    I started Legacy LaundryCare for the people who need it most—and for those who simply want a little more breathing room in their day. For the busy parent who starts a load of laundry and forgets it in the washer for days, only to rewash it again and again to chase out that stubborn mildew smell. For the mom who juggles work, kids, and activities, and somehow gets the laundry to the dryer—but it never quite makes it out. It lives in baskets or on the couch, shuffled through daily in search of that favorite hoodie or towel.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started this because I was that mom. Overwhelmed, stretched thin, and constantly rewashing forgotten loads. I know what it’s like to feel behind on something as basic as clean clothes. And I know how much peace it brings when someone steps in to help.
  </p>

  <p>
    Legacy LaundryCare is for moms, dads, caregivers, professionals—for anyone who’s busy, tired, or just ready to hand off the laundry and reclaim their time. You’re not just a client here. You’re part of a community that values care, transparency, and real-life solutions.
