  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>By using Legacy LaundryCare, you agree to the following terms and service rules. These apply to both guest and registered clients.</p>

  <h2>Service Agreement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All laundry is handled with care, but Legacy LaundryCare is not responsible for items damaged due to manufacturer defects, prior wear, or improper labeling.</li>
    <li>Pickup and delivery times are scheduled based on availability and may be adjusted with notice.</li>
    <li>Clients must provide accurate contact information and delivery instructions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Guest users authorize payment at booking. Charges are captured only after service is completed.</li>
    <li>Registered users may save payment methods via Stripe and authorize holds per booking.</li>
    <li>Final charges are based on weight, service tier, and selected add-ons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Privacy & Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Client data is stored securely via Supabase and Stripe. We do not sell or share your information.</li>
    <li>Preferences and contact info may be used to improve service quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Disruptions & Alternate Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In rare cases, service delays may occur due to weather, road work, or utility outages. We will notify clients promptly and adjust delivery times as needed.</li>
    <li>Laundry may be processed using a combination of personal machines and commercial laundromats. All locations meet our cleanliness and quality standards.</li>
    <li>If water service is interrupted due to city maintenance, we will seek alternative solutions—including travel to nearby towns—to complete orders on time.</li>
    <li>Clients will be informed of any alternate processing locations and delivery updates in real time via the website or app.</li>
    <li>For full details, please refer to our <a href="rules.html" target="_blank">Service Rules</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Updates</h2>
  <p>Terms may be updated periodically. Registered users will be prompted to re-accept if changes are made.</p>
