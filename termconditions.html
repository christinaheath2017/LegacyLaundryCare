  <p>By using Legacy LaundryCare, you agree to the following terms. These apply to both guest and registered clients. For service expectations and handling policies, please refer to our <a href="rules.html" target="_blank">Service Rules</a>.</p>

  <h2>Service Agreement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We handle all laundry with care, but are not liable for damage caused by manufacturer defects, prior wear, or unlabeled items.</li>
    <li>Pickup and delivery times may be adjusted based on availability, weather, or road conditions. Clients will be notified promptly.</li>
    <li>Clients must provide accurate contact details and clear delivery instructions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Guest users authorize payment at booking. Charges are captured only after service is completed.</li>
    <li>Registered users may save payment methods via Stripe and authorize holds per booking.</li>
    <li>Final charges are based on weight, service tier, and selected add-ons.</li>

<h2>Payment Failure & Escalation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Final charges are captured after service completion. If payment fails, clients will be notified immediately and prompted to update billing information.</li>
  <li>Orders with failed payment will not be delivered. Status will be marked as <strong>“Payment Failed”</strong>.</li>
  <li>After 24 hours, a holding fee of $10/day begins. After 5 days, the order enters <strong>“Donation Status”</strong> and fees increase to $15/day plus a 15% service fee.</li>
  <li>If payment is not resolved within 10 days, the order is considered abandoned. Items may be donated, repurposed, or sold to recover service costs. The client’s account will be permanently closed and blacklisted.</li>
