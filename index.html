  <h1>Welcome to the Legacy Family</h1>

  <p>I started Legacy LaundryCare for the people who need it most—and for those who simply want a little more breathing room in their day. For the busy parent who starts a load of laundry and forgets it in the washer for days, only to rewash it again and again to chase out that stubborn mildew smell. For the mom who juggles work, kids, and activities, and somehow gets the laundry to the dryer—but it never quite makes it out. It lives in baskets or on the couch, shuffled through daily in search of that favorite hoodie or towel.</p>

  <p>I started this because I was that mom. Overwhelmed, stretched thin, and constantly rewashing forgotten loads. I know what it’s like to feel behind on something as basic as clean clothes. And I know how much peace it brings when someone steps in to help.</p>

  <p>But there’s more to the story. I used to drive over an hour—each way—just to pick up and return laundry orders. I kept waiting for a service like this to come to Warsaw, Indiana and the surrounding areas. It never did. So I built it myself.</p>

  <p>Legacy LaundryCare is for Warsaw. For the busy parents, professionals, travelers, and anyone who just wants clean socks and a fresh towel but finds laundry slipping through the cracks of daily life. You’re not just a client here. You’re part of a community that values care, transparency, and real-life solutions.</p>
