  <h1>Service Rules</h1>
  <p>To ensure a smooth and respectful experience for all clients, please follow these service guidelines:</p>

  <h2>Before Pickup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Place laundry in tied bags labeled with your name.</li>
    <li>Remove any items that require dry cleaning or special handling.</li>
    <li>Include clear instructions if you have allergies or product sensitivities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>During Service</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not separate colors unless requested.</li>
    <li>We use your selected detergent and softener preferences.</li>
    <li>We do not wash items with bodily fluids, pet waste, or hazardous materials.</li>
    <li>Delicates needing special care must be separated and clearly marked “Delicate.”</li>
    <li>Items requiring stain treatment (available only for Standard orders) must be bagged and labeled separately from the rest.</li>
    <li>Items requiring hang drying (Standard orders only) must be placed in a separate bag and clearly marked.</li>
    <li>Items requiring return on hangers must be in separate bags with hangers included. We do not supply hangers. Bags must be clearly marked.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>After Delivery</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspect your items promptly and report any concerns within 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Receipts are provided digitally and on paper.</li>
    <li>Tips are optional and can be added via your Stripe receipt.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Service Disruptions & Transparency</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In the event of bad weather (e.g. storms, snow, flooding), delays may occur due to travel safety, utility grid failures, or power outages. We will notify clients promptly if their pickup or delivery is affected.</li>
    <li>Clients acknowledge that laundry may be processed using a combination of personal machines and commercial laundromats. We ensure all locations meet our cleanliness and quality standards.</li>
    <li>Road work and traffic disruptions may slightly alter pickup and delivery times. Every effort will be made to avoid delays, but some are unavoidable. Clients will be informed of any changes.</li>
    <li>Occasionally, the city may shut off water to perform maintenance on sewage or water lines. If this occurs, clients will be notified immediately. We will seek alternative solutions to complete orders on time, including traveling to another town if necessary.</li>
    <li>In such cases, clients will be informed of the alternate laundromat’s name and location. Transparency is our priority.</li>
    <li>Once laundry is enroute for delivery, the website (and future app) will display real-time tracking. Clients will see a message like: “Your laundry delivery is enroute. There are XX deliveries before yours. You can follow the route in real time via the website or app.”</li>
  </ul>
